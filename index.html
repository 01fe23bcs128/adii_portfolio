<!-- Business Cases Section -->
<div id="business-cases" class="section">
    <h2 class="highlight">Business Cases Identified by Aditi Choudhary (01FE23BCS128)</h2>
    <p class="intro-text">Below are the key business cases identified for the city's growth and sustainability:</p>

    <h3>1. Industrial Expansion üè≠</h3>
    <p>
        As Chitranagari grows, it aims to establish itself as a hub for industrial development. The business case for industrial expansion involves the creation of dedicated industrial zones to boost economic growth and job opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
        These zones will include small-scale, medium-scale, and large-scale industries with adequate infrastructure, such as efficient road networks, power supply, and waste management systems. The motive is twofold:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Attract investments from domestic and international companies.</li>
        <li>Utilize the revenue generated for further development of the city.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Sustainable practices, such as green manufacturing units and carbon-neutral goals, will be incorporated to ensure environmental responsibility.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Healthcare Infrastructure üè•</h3>
    <p>
        A smart city must prioritize the well-being of its citizens. This business case focuses on building a robust healthcare ecosystem, including multi-specialty hospitals, community health centers, and digital health facilities for remote consultations.
    </p>
    <p>
        With advanced healthcare systems integrated with AI and IoT, Chitranagari aims to provide efficient and accessible services to its citizens. Preventive healthcare initiatives, like fitness zones, parks, and awareness programs, will also be introduced.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, the plan includes public health monitoring systems and a centralized emergency response mechanism to enhance healthcare delivery.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Education Hub üéì</h3>
    <p>
        Chitranagari envisions becoming an educational powerhouse by establishing a network of schools, colleges, and research institutions. This business case focuses on creating a smart education system integrated with cutting-edge technology, including e-learning platforms, virtual labs, and interactive classrooms.
    </p>
    <p>
        Special emphasis will be placed on skill development and vocational training centers to prepare students for future industries. Partnerships with global universities and organizations will be encouraged to foster innovation and knowledge exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
        Scholarships and affordable education programs will be introduced to ensure inclusivity and accessibility for all citizens.

   <!-- Course Reflections Section -->
<div id="course-reflections" class="section">
    <h2>Course Learning Outcomes</h2>

    <h3>1. What are the kinds of problems we see in nature?</h3>
    <p>Nature provides numerous examples of problem-solving approaches:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Iteration:</strong> Tides rise and fall in a regular, repeated pattern.</li>
        <li><strong>Recursion:</strong> A cauliflower looks identical at every level, from stem to tip.</li>
        <li><strong>Backtracking:</strong> Solving a maze by retracing steps when hitting a dead end.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These natural patterns inspire solutions to similar problems in algorithm design.</p>

    <h3>2. What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important?</h3>
    <p><strong>Time efficiency:</strong> Measures how fast an algorithm performs.</p>
    <p><strong>Space efficiency:</strong> Measures how much additional memory it requires.</p>
    <p>If an algorithm is slow or consumes excessive memory, it becomes impractical for large-scale problems.</p>

    <h4>Types of Growth in Algorithms:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Constant time (O(1)):</strong> Performance remains the same regardless of input size.</li>
        <li><strong>Logarithmic time (O(log n)):</strong> Slows slightly as input grows.</li>
        <li><strong>Linear time (O(n)):</strong> Performance slows proportionally with input size.</li>
        <li><strong>Linearithmic time (O(n log n)):</strong> Slower than linear, but manageable.</li>
        <li><strong>Quadratic time (O(n¬≤)):</strong> Becomes significantly slower with larger inputs.</li>
        <li><strong>Cubic time (O(n¬≥)):</strong> Even slower than quadratic.</li>
        <li><strong>Exponential (O(2‚Åø)) and Factorial (O(n!)):</strong> Infeasible for large inputs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. What are the takeaways from different design principles?</h3>
    <p>Effective problem-solving relies on various design principles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Divide and Conquer:</strong> Break a problem into smaller parts, solve them individually, and combine results.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Programming:</strong> Store solutions to subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.</li>
        <li><strong>Greedy Algorithms:</strong> Choose the optimal solution at each step.</li>
        <li><strong>Backtracking:</strong> Explore all possibilities and revert incorrect decisions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These principles improve algorithm performance and simplify complex problems.</p>

    <h3>4. How do tree data structures solve problems?</h3>
    <p>Trees provide an organized way to store hierarchical data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Binary Search Tree (BST):</strong> Efficient for searching sorted data but may become unbalanced.</li>
        <li><strong>AVL Tree:</strong> A self-balancing BST for optimal performance.</li>
        <li><strong>2-3 Tree:</strong> Handles dynamic data effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Red-Black Tree:</strong> A balanced tree with fewer rebalancing operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Heap:</strong> Quickly finds the largest or smallest value.</li>
        <li><strong>Trie:</strong> Ideal for searching words or prefixes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Why do we need array query algorithms?</h3>
    <p>Array query algorithms enhance efficiency in answering range-based questions (e.g., finding the sum or maximum).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Prefix Sums:</strong> Quickly calculate sums over any range.</li>
        <li><strong>Segment Trees and Fenwick Trees:</strong> Enable fast updates and queries.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Applications include gaming, financial systems, and databases.</p>

    <h3>6. What is the difference between trees and graphs?</h3>
    <p><strong>Trees:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> A strict hierarchy with no loops (e.g., family trees).</li>
        <li><strong>Traversals:</strong> Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder for hierarchical analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Applications:</strong> File organization, decision-making systems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Graphs:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Structure:</strong> A collection of nodes and edges, allowing loops (e.g., road maps).</li>
        <li><strong>Traversals:</strong> Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) for exploring networks.</li>
        <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Social networks, routing, and navigation systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7. What about sorting and searching algorithms?</h3>
    <p><strong>Sorting Algorithms:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Simple Algorithms:</strong> Bubble Sort works well for small datasets.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficient Algorithms:</strong> Quick Sort and Merge Sort are suitable for large datasets.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Searching Algorithms:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Linear Search:</strong> Scans each element, slower but works with unsorted data.</li>
        <li><strong>Binary Search:</strong> Operates on sorted data for faster performance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Real-life Applications:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sorting algorithms rank search results or organize data.</li>
        <li>Searching algorithms locate contacts or find optimal paths in maps.</li>
    </ul>
