    <p class="intro-text">Below are the key business cases identified for the city's growth and sustainability:</p>

    <h3>1. Industrial Expansion üè≠</h3>
    <p>
        As Chitranagari grows, it aims to establish itself as a hub for industrial development. The business case for industrial expansion involves the creation of dedicated industrial zones to boost economic growth and job opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
        These zones will include small-scale, medium-scale, and large-scale industries with adequate infrastructure, such as efficient road networks, power supply, and waste management systems. The motive is twofold:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Attract investments from domestic and international companies.</li>
        <li>Utilize the revenue generated for further development of the city.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Sustainable practices, such as green manufacturing units and carbon-neutral goals, will be incorporated to ensure environmental responsibility.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Healthcare Infrastructure üè•</h3>

    <p>
        With advanced healthcare systems integrated with AI and IoT, Chitranagari aims to provide efficient and accessible services to its citizens. Preventive healthcare initiatives, like fitness zones, parks, and awareness programs, will also be introduced.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, the plan includes public health monitoring systems and a centralized emergency response mechanism to enhance healthcare delivery.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Education Hub üéì</h3>
    <p>
        Chitranagari envisions becoming an educational powerhouse by establishing a network of schools, colleges, and research institutions. This business case focuses on creating a smart education system integrated with cutting-edge technology, including e-learning platforms, virtual labs, and interactive classrooms.
    </p>

        Special emphasis will be placed on skill development and vocational training centers to prepare students for future industries. Partnerships with global universities and organizations will be encouraged to foster innovation and knowledge exchange.
